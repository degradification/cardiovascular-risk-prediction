* Naive Bayes Bernoulli
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Random Forest
* Neural Network

In order to compile and run the code, make sure the cardio_train.csv is downloaded in a 'data' directory as the code. When running the Neural Network model, create a directory within your working directory named 'logs' so that the Neural Network model  will output its logs to that folder. To run the rest of the notebook, just run each cell individually or all at once.
